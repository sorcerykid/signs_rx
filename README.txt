Signs Redux Mod v1.1
By Leslie Krause

I completely rewrote default signs as a standalone mod with many new features! It's now 
possible to view the full text of a sign within a custom sized and colored formspec 
combined with an advanced markup language specifically tailored for Minetest formspecs 
with simple-to-use tags for layout and formatting (i.e. color, header, border, rows and 
columns, etc.) and builtin word-wrapping within all cells.
